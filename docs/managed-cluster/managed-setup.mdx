# Managed Cluster setup

The managed cluster setup offers a step-by-step setup for a new kubernetes cluster. 

Ideally the clusters should be managed by **argocd** but there is still some initial setup to be done to allow the cluster to communicate with the outside world. 


We assume that you already have the cluster of you choice set up. To make sure you are using a fresh cluster run: 

```sh
kubeclt get namespaces
```

The output should look like this 

```buttonless
$ kubectl get namespaces
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   138d
kube-node-lease   Active   40m
kube-public       Active   138d
kube-system       Active   138d
```

So now we have a clean cluster its time to get started.

## Nginx

Most clusters want to allow users to access at least certain parts of it from outside the cluster. While we can expose specific node ports outside the cluster, a load balancer makes the most sense and allows us to have more control over our routes in a central place. 

Load balancers expose the cluster to the outside world in a safe and manageable way while proving a lot of additional features

While there are a few different load balancers out there we will be using the [NGINX](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/) load balancer. 

We will be using helm to install nginx as it is the easiest way to get it up and running.

```sh
# WE WILL USE THE NAMESPACE ingress-nginx WHICH IS CREATED FOR US 

helm upgrade --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx \
  --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx \
  --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace
  --set controller.service.annotations."service\.beta\.kubernetes\.io/azure-load-balancer-health-probe-request-path"=/healthz
```

A few pods should start in the ingress-nginx namespace:
```sh
kubectl get pods --namespace=ingress-nginx
```

After a while, they should all be running. The following command will wait for the ingress controller pod to be up, running, and ready:

```sh
kubectl wait --namespace ingress-nginx \
  --for=condition=ready pod \
  --selector=app.kubernetes.io/component=controller \
  --timeout=120s
```

:::caution
  Some kubernetes environments require additional configuration before setting up the load balancer 
:::

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Azure" label="Azure" default>

````sh 
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.4.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
````
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Load Balancer

Having created the nginx ingress we can now create our generic load balancer.
```
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: ingress-nginx-controller
  namespace: ingress-nginx
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: ingress-nginx
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: ingress-nginx
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      targetPort: http
    - name: https
      port: 443
      targetPort: https      
EOF

```

You load balancer should be set up now with all the bells and whistles 


## Cert Manager

The cert manager is responsible for creating certificates for you apps and making sure that they are kept up to date. 

We will be using lets encrypt for as our certification authority. 
We will also be using helm to deploy our cert-manager

Add helm repo and update repo
```sh title="Add repo and update repo"
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update
```


Now we need to apply the custom resource definition (CRD)
```sh 
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.10.0/cert-manager.crds.yaml
```



:::caution 
If cert-manager already exists you can remove it using 

```
helm uninstall cert-manager --namespace cert-manager
```
:::




Now let install cert manager

```sh 
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --version v1.10.0  --create-namespace --set installCRDs=true

```


After setting up the cert manager we need to set up a cluster issuer. 
The cluster issuer is responsible for creating certificates in all namespaces

```sh title="Cluster issuer"
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: le-clusterissuer
  namespace: cert-manager
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: iot@nimbit.de
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: le-clusterissuer
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class:  nginx
EOF
         
```
