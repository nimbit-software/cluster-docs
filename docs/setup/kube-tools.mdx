# Kube Tools

For the most part everything we are gonna do is independent of the cluster provider. 

The best way to get started in so use minikube on you local pc to try out different kubernetes features. 

## Minikube

[Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) provides the user with a nearly full featured kubernetes cluster running on a vm on your local machine. 

Its possible to use different vms with minikube but the most simple with windows is the integrated Hyper-V virtual machine. 

You can fine the official install documentation from minikube here [install minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) 

### Hyper-V (For windows users)

For windows users we can set Hyper-V as the default driver for minikube.
```bash
minikube config set driver hyperv
```

Or you can simply start minikube with hyper-v

```bash"
minikube start --driver=hyperv 
```

### Dashboard
Minikube comes kube dashboard installed out of the box as a service it makes interacting with the cluster easier via a graphical interface. 

You can start it using. 
```bash
minikube dashboard
```


### Cheat sheet

Here are you most useful minikube commands.
```bash
# Start minikube
minikube start

# Stop minikube 
minikube stop 

# Pause Cluster
minikube pause

# Unpause cluster
minikube unpause

```

## Kubectl 

Your most important tool for interacting with your kubernetes cluster is kubectl. It allows you to interact with the kubernetes api via the command line and is essential when deploying apps to you cluster or interacting with the cluster in general. 

### Installation

The easiest way to install kubectl on a windows machine is via Chocolatey(choco). 

:::note

If you don't have choco installed, simply open powershell as and administrator and enter the following. 

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1')) 
```

To test that the installation was successful simply enter **choco**

:::

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Choco" label="Choco" default>

````bash
choco install kubernetes-cli
````

You can test the installation by running **kubectl**

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

For auto complete in power-shell you can also run the following in power-shell 

```bash title=powershell
kubectl completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```


## Kube tools 

Here are some of my favorite kubernetes tools that can make you life easier especially when dealing with
multiple clusters.

### Krew

Krew is a great tool for managing and installing kubectl plugins. 
You can find the installation information [here](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/#windows)

After having installed Krew here are a few useful plugins:

- cert-manager
- get-all
- ingress-nginx
- config-cleanup
- doctor
- multiforward
- deprecations

Each of the plugins can be installed using the cli 

```bash
kubectl krew install <plugin>

# Example
kubectl krew install get-all
```

### Kubectx and Kubens

[Kubectx](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) is a great tool for managing the current context
and allows you to quickly switch between kubernetes contexts.

**Kubens** on the other hand allows you to quickly switch between namespaces without having to add the namespace with every command

They can easily be installed using chocolatey

```bash
choco install kubens kubectx
```


### K9s 

[K9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s) offers a different type of interface for
interacting with you cluster. It offers a terminal UI that you can use to easily navigate 
your cluster and perform actions.

For more details please view the github page.

```bash
choco install k9s
```

## Helm 

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for kubernetes and allows us to deploy apps as a complete 
bundle using a template mechanism. This allows us to easily adapt all aspects of the app
to different customers simply by making changes to a values.yaml file

The simplest way to install helm is once again with Chocolatey

```bash
choco install kubernetes-helm
```
