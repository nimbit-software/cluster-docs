# Managed Cluster setup

The managed cluster setup offers a step-by-step setup for a new kubernetes cluster. 

Ideally the clusters should be managed by **argocd** but there is still some initial setup to be done to allow the cluster to communicate with the outside world. 


We assume that you already have the cluster of you choice set up. To make sure you are using a fresh cluster run: 

```bash
kubectl get namespaces
```

The output should look like this 

```buttonless
$ kubectl get namespaces
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   138d
kube-node-lease   Active   40m
kube-public       Active   138d
kube-system       Active   138d
```

So now we have a clean cluster its time to get started.

## Nginx & Load Balancer v1.5.1

Most clusters want to allow users to access at least certain parts of it from outside the cluster. While we can expose specific node ports outside the cluster, a load balancer makes the most sense and allows us to have more control over our routes in a central place. 

Load balancers expose the cluster to the outside world in a safe and manageable way while proving a lot of additional features

While there are a few different load balancers out there we will be using the [NGINX](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/) load balancer. 

We will be using helm to install nginx as it is the easiest way to get it up and running.

  <TabItem value="Azure" label="Azure" default>

````bash 
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.4.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml

First, your user needs to have cluster-admin permissions on the cluster. This can be done with the following command:

````bash 
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
  --clusterrole cluster-admin \
  --user $(gcloud config get-value account)
````
Then, the ingress controller can be installed like this:
````bash 
kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding \
  --clusterrole cluster-admin \
  --user $(gcloud config get-value account)
````

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.5.1/deploy/static/provider/aws/deploy.yaml
````  
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
If we want to increase the replica count of our ingress controller this can be done by modifying the deployment.

```bash title="Increase replicas"
kubectl scale --replicas=2 deployment ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx
```
:::


Your ingress controller and load balancer should be set up now with all the bells and whistles 


## Cert Manager

The cert manager is responsible for creating certificates for you apps and making sure that they are kept up to date. 

We will be using lets encrypt for as our certification authority. 
We will also be using helm to deploy our cert-manager

Add helm repo and update repo
```bash title="Add repo and update repo"
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
helm repo update
```


Now we need to apply the custom resource definition (CRD)
```bash 
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.10.0/cert-manager.crds.yaml
```



:::caution 
If cert-manager already exists you can remove it using 

```
helm uninstall cert-manager --namespace cert-manager
```
:::




Now let install cert manager

```bash 
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --version v1.10.0  --create-namespace --set installCRDs=true

```


After setting up the cert manager we need to set up a cluster issuer. 
The cluster issuer is responsible for creating certificates in all namespaces

```bash title="Cluster issuer"
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: le-clusterissuer
  namespace: cert-manager
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    email: iot@nimbit.de
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: le-clusterissuer
    solvers:
    - http01:
        ingress:
          class:  nginx
EOF

```


```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: udp-services
  namespace: ingress-nginx
EOF

```



```bash
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: tcp-services
  namespace: ingress-nginx
EOF

```
