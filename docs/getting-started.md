# Cluster docs

Welcome to the cluster docs. 
The goal here is to provide a set by set guide for setting up an managing a nimbit Kubernetes cluster along with documenting all steps needed to get you up and running. 

This is a living documentation and will be updated step by step as new apps and features are added to the cluster.
